                <p class="intro"> Kholiswa is a woman of incomparable intelligence,
                    compassion, beauty and indefatigable ambition.
                    She learnt to speak her mind, stand up strong,
                    be a women and a phenomenal one. She built her
                    legs to walk on a red carpet every time she passes
                    in a room. She is a Queen because she has herself to be.
                    She speaks with the passion of Maya Angelou and runs her world
                    like Beyonce Knowles. She dreams like Martin and stands firm
                    like Rosa Parks. Because building herself the way she wants, it is
                    the greatest thing other than the moon.
